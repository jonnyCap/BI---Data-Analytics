Due to the mismatch between the columns in the schema and in the actual dataset, we first went through the schmema to select the columns to drop, but then had to additionally go through the dataset to select the columns there as well. This is why there are potentially column names listed to be dropped, while not even existent in the csv.\n",

    "   2. Systemic Multi-Label Complexity: \n",
    "      - Features: 'Language', 'Platform', 'Webframe', 'OpSys', 'DevEnvs' are ALL semicolon-separated strings.\n",
    "      - Dominance: 'React', 'Node.js', and 'AWS' are dominant but often appear in combinations (e.g., \"Next.js;Node.js;React\").\n",
    "      - Action: Simple one-hot encoding is insufficient; we must perform string splitting/tokenization to capture individual technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Professional Filtering ('MainBranch'):\n",
    "      - The category \"I am a developer by profession\" vastly outweighs others (students, hobbyists).\n",
    "      - Action: To ensure regression quality for salary prediction, we should filter the dataset to include ONLY professional developers.\n",

    "      - Sentiment/Likert ('JobSatPoints', 'TechEndorse', 'TechOppose'): These display discrete, \"spiky\" distributions at integer intervals. While technically ordinal, they can often be treated as continuous features in regression models to capture trends.\n",

    "      - 'RemoteWork': \"Remote\" and \"Hybrid\" are the norms; \"In-person\" is a distinct minority.\n",
    "      - 'OpSys': High prevalence of \"Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)\", indicating that OS usage is no longer binary (Windows vs. Linux) but often hybrid.\n",

    "1. ConvertedCompYearly (Target): Visual analysis showed extreme right-skewness with a massive spike near zero and a long tail extending to 50M. IQR is applied to remove these extremes to prevent regression coefficients from being dominated by outliers.\n",
    "2. WorkExp & YearsCode (Features): Histograms revealed a right-skewed distribution. Boxplots identified values > ~40-50 years as statistical outliers. While physically possible, these high-leverage points can skew the slope of linear models and are removed via IQR.\n",
    "3. Note on Categoricals: High cardinality and rare labels were observed in DevType, Country, and Industry (long tails), while MainBranch shows extreme imbalance. These will be handled in the Data Preparation phase via Frequency Thresholding (grouping rare labels into 'Other') or Binary Grouping, rather than statistical outlier removal.\n",
    "4. Note on Ordinals: Low values in JobSat (0-2) are confirmed as valid negative sentiment, not errors, and will be retained. However, non-informative labels found in ordinal columns (e.g., 'I don't know' in OrgSize, 'Prefer not to say' in Age) are flagged for exclusion or imputation during Data Preparation.\n",
    "5. Note on Ranked Features: This has already been done. The columns with highest correlation to the target were retained, while weakly correlated ranking features were dropped. These can stay as is for modeling.\n",

    "   A major ethical issue is whether broad survey data is suitable for predicting an individual's salary. Surveys look at general statistics and often miss a person's unique situation. If we use this model for real-world pay decisions, we risk unfairly capping the salary of employees who don't fit the \"average\" profile, which could negatively impact their livelihoods.\n",
    "   We also see bias regarding geography and money. The data clusters respondents from countries like Ukraine (using UAH) versus Western nations (using USD or EUR).\n",
    "   If the model doesn't account for the cost of living differences, it might unfairly rate senior developers from these regions as \"low value.\" There is also a risk of ageism because the data lumps everyone over 65 into one group, which might make the model think older people use less technology.\n",

    "\n",
    "risk_text = \"\"\"\n",
    "f. Risks & External Questions:\n",
    "   A fundamental risk is that we cannot verify if survey respondents are telling the truth. Self-reported data often contains exaggerated claims or \"liars,\" and this dishonesty might correlate with specific locations or age groups, creating hidden biases we cannot easily detect.\n",
    "   Financially, the 'CompTotal' column is very risky because it mixes local currencies—some people report in thousands (EUR) and others in millions (UAH). Because these numbers are incomparable, 'CompTotal' will not be part of our final dataset.\n",
    "   We must rely on 'ConvertedCompYearly' instead, but this value is missing for many users (like students), which creates gaps in our data.\n",
    "   Subjective questions also pose a risk; for example, a person's fear of AI might skew their answers about productivity.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "action_plan_text = \"\"\" g. Preparation Action Plan:\n",
    "    The data preparation strategy begins with removing rows where the target variable ConvertedCompYearly is missing, as imputing salary would introduce unacceptable noise for the business objective.\n",
    "    We will also remove the CompTotal and Currency columns to prevent multicollinearity and magnitude errors once the converted salary is confirmed.\n",
    "    For cleaning, we must filter outliers in YearsCode, converting string descriptions into numeric values.\n",
    "    Imputation will be applied to WorkExp using the median experience of corresponding age groups, and missing values in Likert-scale columns like TechEndorse will be assumed to indicate no endorsement.\n",
    "    Feature engineering will focus on splitting semicolon-delimited strings in LanguageHaveWorkedWith into multi-hot encoded boolean flags.\n",
    "    Finally, we will reduce high cardinality in the Country column by binning nations into broader regions and convert ordinal OrgSize ranges into numeric estimates to facilitate correlation analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Summary:\n",
    "    - Remove Columns on Personal Decisions: So as there are many columns, which are most likely irreleavnt to the target variable, we decided to removed many of them.\n",
    "    - Remove Columns due to Correlation: From these pre selected columns, we further removed columns, which had low correlation with the target variable. Allthough 'YearsCode' and 'WorkExp' had low correlation, we kept them due to their domain relevance. We also kept the Ranking columns despite low correlation to the target, as combined they may provide useful signal.\n",
    "    - Target Cleaning: Remove rows missing 'ConvertedCompYearly' to ensure valid regression targets.\n",
    "    - Outlier Removal: Apply IQR method to 'ConvertedCompYearly' and 'YearsCode' to remove extreme values.\n",
    "    - Imputation: Fill missing 'WorkExp' using age-group medians; set null 'TechEndorse' to 0.\n",
    "    - Changing Ranking Orders: For columns that belong to a ranking group (e.g. TechEndorse_1, TechEndorse_2, ...), we have to inverse the order, so that higher values indicate stronger endorsement.\n",
    "    - Ordinal Encoding: For Ordinal columns like 'OrgSize', map ranges to numeric points that represent the order.\n",
    "    - Norminal Encoding: For Categorical columns like 'Country', reduce cardinality by only using the top N countries and group the rest into \"Others\".\n",
    "    - Mutli-Select Encoding: For Mutli-Select columns like 'LanguageHaveWorkedWith', split semicolon-delimited strings into separate boolean columns for each language.\n",
